post_excerpt: Testing with an explicit post_date field
---

## Introduction

This test post includes an explicit `post_date` field set to today's date and time.

## Why This Test

The previous test posts did not include a `post_date` field, which might have caused the Git it Write plugin to skip them.

## Conclusion

If this post appears in WordPress, it means the `post_date` field is required for the plugin to process the file.
